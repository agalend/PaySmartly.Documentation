# 1. motivation

This solution has one main purpose - it should show you how I think, approach a task and give you a basic overview of my technical skills. 
I have tried to scratch an end to end solution instead of deep diving into particular modules, so that you can have a full understanding
regarding my software development life cycle comprehension.

Please, keep in mind that I was not able to tailor each and every module since I had to finish the task in a reasonable time frame.

# 2. assumptions

First, I want to notice that I have no payroll experience whatsoever. As you can imagine the closest touch I have to payroll is while I get my salary. That's why I had done the following research:

 - I checked https://www.employment.govt.nz/ and https://www.employment.govt.nz/hours-and-wages/pay/payslip/ in order to find out the base payroll's ingredients. It turned out that it is a much complex than I expected. However, I was able to get the very initial impression of what is an payroll process.

 - I checked several online salary calculators in order to see what input data they need. I also used them in order to validate my solution.

 - One interesting think I noticed while I was playing with those salary calculators was that they calculate the net income a little bit different:

    netIncome = grossIncome - incomeTax - super

    However, I stuck to your task description and calculated the net income according to your expectations. However, you can see a comment reflecting this difference: [see here](https://github.com/agalend/PaySmartly.Calculations/blob/master/PaySmartly.Calculations/Calculations/Formulas.cs)
